    And I've been all about front end development since April 2020, when I
    realized coding and design was my jam. Since then I've been committed to
    self-studying, and every day I'm learning something new. I have a great
    handle on <span>HTML</span>, <span>JavaScript</span> and <span>CSS</span>,
    and I'm especially excited about creating <span>React</span> apps.

    I've also created <span>WordPress</span> themes, <span>D3</span> data
    visualizations and currently I'm studying <span>Bootstrap</span> and{' '}
    <span>Redux</span>.

    My learning process has been guided by the curriculum at FreeCodeCamp.com,
    where I've earned four certificates so far. I also learn by constantly
    creating new projects and researching different approaches, methods and
    frameworks.
